\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
First of all, I would like thank Almighty God for His kindness.

Then I would like to thank my honorable adviser Professor Antonella De Angeli
who give me the opportunity to work with her and to carry out this thesis work.
During my work, her guidance and advice, especially in the time of my research
helped me come across a long way to accomplish this thesis work. Unless her
supports, inspirations, and encouragements it would have been impossible to finish
this thesis.

I would like to thank Silvia Torsi for providing ideas and some materials
related to this  work.

I am grateful to my mother Franchilia Philip and fiancee Tithi Florence D'Costa to
encourage me all the time to complete this work.

My heartiest gratitude to all Bangladeshi students in Trento, especially Ashish
Kumer Basak, Abdullah Al-Mamun, Tohedul Islam, Abarat Hossain, Miah Raihan
Mahmud Arman, Kazi Asad Robin, Nazmul Hassan, Abdul Hannan Azad and Nur Alam
Labu to support me all the time and unless their help, it would have been tough
to accomplish this work.
