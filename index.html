<p>Mobile Human-Computer Interaction is the relationship (interaction) between
people and their handheld mobile systems and the applications which
we use in our everyday life. In a word, mobile applications are interactive
products to support users in their day to day life no matter where they are.
Since technology is moving fast and changing rapidly, it is very important
to understand the mobile interaction techniques and the impact of possible
mobile technologies on human life. Mobile HCI concerns about the mobile
applications and PDA which discusses the different possible interaction techniques
with those applications. In the university cafeteria provides services
manually to the students which cause different kinds of problems such as
losing time in cafeteria queue, unable to browse and choose meal in advance,
does not provides any kind of dieting advises to students which help them
to keep proper dieting. In this thesis, I have proposed an adaptive, interactive
mobile application which is called “Smart Cafeteria” that will provide
services to the university students and faculties for managing their meal in
the universities’ cafeterias which in consequence makes their life more easy
and comfortable. In this work from beginning to end, I have followed HCI
interaction design methodology in every step such as problem define, data
gathering, requirement analysis, prototype development and usability evaluation
for “Smart Cafeteria” application.</p>

<p>The template prototype was designed using html5, css3, twitter bootstrap, jQuery which gives  Responsive design prototype. I have used Eclipse IDE with Apache server to run the application prototype. Finally using phonegap I have built android apps prototype to evaluate prototype using user study.</p>
