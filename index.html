<p>MobileMobile Human-Computer Interaction is the relationship (interaction) between people and their handheld mobile systems and the applications which they use in their everyday life. In one word, mobile applications are interactive products to support users in their day to day life no matter where they are. Since technology is moving fast and changing rapidly, it is very important to understand the mobile interaction techniques and also the possible impact of mobile technologies in human life. Mobile HCI concerns about mobile applications and mobile platforms which discusses the different possible interaction echniques with those applications. The university cafeteria provides services manually to the students which causes different kind of problems such as losing time in cafeteria queue, unable to browse and choose meal in advance, not providing any kind of dieting advices to students which helps them to follow proper diet. In this thesis, I have proposed an adaptive and interactive mobile application called “Smart Cafeteria” which will provide services to the university students and faculty members to manage their meal in the university cafeterias which in consequence makes their life more easy and comfortable. I have followed HCI interaction design methodology in every step such as problem define, data gathering, requirement analysis, prototype development and usability evaluation for “Smart Cafeteria” application.

<p>The template prototype was designed using html5, css3, twitter bootstrap, jQuery which gives  Responsive design prototype. I have used Eclipse IDE with Apache server to run the application prototype. Finally using phonegap I have built android apps prototype to evaluate prototype using user study.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like thank Almighty God for His kindness.
Then I would like to thank my honorable adviser Professor Antonella De
Angeli who give me the opportunity to work with her and to carry out this
thesis work. During my work, her guidance and advice, especially in the time
of my research helped me come across a long way to accomplish this thesis
work. Unless her supports, inspirations, and encouragements it would have
been impossible to finish this thesis.
I would like to thank Silvia Torsi for providing ideas and some materials
related to this work.
I am grateful to my mother Franchilia Philip and fiancee Tithi Florence
D’Costa to encourage me all the time to complete this work.
My heartiest gratitude to all Bangladeshi students in Trento, especially
Ashish Kumer Basak, Abdullah Al-Mamun, Tohedul Islam, Abarat Hossain,
Miah Raihan Mahmud Arman, Kazi Asad Robin, Nazmul Hassan, Abdul
Hannan Azad and Nur Alam Labu to support me all the time and unless
their help, it would have been tough to accomplish this work.</p>
