In a word, mobile applications are interactive\r\nproducts to support users in their day to day life no matter where they are.\r\nSince technology is moving fast and changing rapidly, it is very important\r\nto understand the mobile interaction techniques and the impact of possible\r\nmobile technologies on human life. Mobile HCI concerns about the mobile\r\napplications and PDA which discusses the different possible interaction techniques\r\nwith those applications. In the university cafeteria provides services\r\nmanually to the students which cause different kinds of problems such as\r\nlosing time in cafeteria queue, unable to browse and choose meal in advance,\r\ndoes not provides any kind of dieting advises to students which help them\r\nto keep proper dieting. In this thesis, I have proposed an adaptive, interactive\r\nmobile application which is called “Smart Cafeteria” that will provide\r\nservices to the university students and faculties for managing their meal in\r\nthe universities’ cafeterias which in consequence makes their life more easy\r\nand comfortable. In this work from beginning to end, I have followed HCI\r\ninteraction design methodology in every step such as problem define, data\r\ngathering, requirement analysis, prototype development and usability evaluation\r\nfor “Smart Cafeteria” application.\r\n\r\n### Smart Cafeteria Template\r\n\r\nThe template prototype was designed using html5, css3, twitter bootstrap, jQuery which gives  Responsive design prototype. I have used Eclipse IDE with Apache server to run the application prototype. Finally using phonegap I have built android apps prototype to evaluate prototype using user study.\r\n\r\n### Smart Cafeteria Report\r\n\r\nThe final Report of Smart Cafeteria has been compiled using Miktex and Eclipse TeXlipse plugins. The report contains all my work from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n### Smart Cafeteria Presentation\r\nThe presentation has been built using Latex Beamer. \r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nFirst of all, I would like thank Almighty God for His kindness.\r\nThen I would like to thank my honorable adviser Professor Antonella De\r\nAngeli who give me the opportunity to work with her and to carry out this\r\nthesis work. During my work, her guidance and advice, especially in the time\r\nof my research helped me come across a long way to accomplish this thesis\r\nwork. Unless her supports, inspirations, and encouragements it would have\r\nbeen impossible to finish this thesis.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank Silvia Torsi for providing ideas and some materials\r\nrelated to this work.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to my beloved Tithi Florence D’Costa to encourage me all\r\nthe time to complete this work.\r\n\r\nMy heartiest gratitude to all Bangladeshi Students in Trento, especially\r\nAshish Kumer Basak, Abdullah al Mamun, Miah Raihan Mahmud Arman, Kazi Asad Robin,\r\nAbarat Hossain, Tohedul Islam to support me all the time and unless their\r\nhelp, it would have been impossible to complete this work.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nThe git repo @\r\nhttps://github.com/suptaphilip/Master-Thesis\r\nIf you have any query, please email me supta.philip@gmail.com .\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
