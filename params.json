{"name":" Adaptive And Interactive Smart Cafeteria Mobile Application","tagline":"This work has done by Supta Richard Philip as master thesis.","body":"### Abstract\r\n\r\nMobile Human-Computer Interaction is the relationship (interaction) between\r\npeople and their handheld mobile systems and the applications which\r\nthey use in their everyday life. In one word, mobile applications are interactive\r\nproducts to support users in their day to day life no matter where they\r\nare. Since technology is moving fast and changing rapidly, it is very important\r\nto understand the mobile interaction techniques and also the possible\r\nimpact of mobile technologies in human life. Mobile HCI concerns about\r\nmobile applications and mobile platforms which discusses the different possible\r\ninteraction techniques with those applications. The university cafeteria\r\nprovides services manually to the students which causes different kind of\r\nproblems such as losing time in cafeteria queue, unable to browse and choose\r\nmeal in advance, not providing any kind of dieting advices to students which\r\nhelps them to follow proper diet. In this thesis, I have proposed an adaptive\r\nand interactive mobile application called “Smart Cafeteria” which will provide\r\nservices to the university students and faculty members to manage their\r\nmeal in the university cafeterias which in consequence makes their life more\r\neasy and comfortable. I have followed HCI interaction design methodology\r\nin every step such as problem define, data gathering, requirement analysis,\r\nprototype development and usability evaluation for “Smart Cafeteria” application.\r\n\r\n### Smart Cafeteria Template\r\n\r\nThe template prototype was designed using html5, css3, twitter bootstrap, jQuery which gives  Responsive design prototype. I have used Eclipse IDE with Apache server to run the application prototype. Finally using phonegap I have built android apps prototype to evaluate prototype using user study.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Smart Cafeteria Report\r\n\r\nThe final Report of Smart Cafeteria has been compiled using Miktex and Eclipse TeXlipse plugins. The report contains all my work from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n### Smart Cafeteria Presentation\r\n\r\nThe presentation has been built using Latex Beamer. \r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nFirst of all, I would like thank Almighty God for His kindness.\r\nThen I would like to thank my honorable adviser Professor Antonella De\r\nAngeli who give me the opportunity to work with her and to carry out this\r\nthesis work. During my work, her guidance and advice, especially in the time\r\nof my research helped me come across a long way to accomplish this thesis\r\nwork. Unless her supports, inspirations, and encouragements it would have\r\nbeen impossible to finish this thesis.\r\nI would like to thank Silvia Torsi for providing ideas and some materials\r\nrelated to this work.\r\nI am grateful to my mother Franchilia Philip and fiancee Tithi Florence\r\nD’Costa to encourage me all the time to complete this work.\r\nMy heartiest gratitude to all Bangladeshi students in Trento, especially\r\nAshish Kumer Basak, Abdullah Al-Mamun, Tohedul Islam, Abarat Hossain,\r\nMiah Raihan Mahmud Arman, Kazi Asad Robin, Nazmul Hassan, Abdul\r\nHannan Azad and Nur Alam Labu to support me all the time and unless\r\ntheir help, it would have been tough to accomplish this work.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nThe git page @\r\nhttp://suptaphilip.github.io/Master-Thesis/\r\n\r\nIf you have any query, please email me supta.philip@gmail.com .\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
